# libjpeg-rbx

> A high-performance library for efficient JPEG image handling, designed specifically for Roblox and Luau

Work in progress. Expect a lot of work and documentation to be done soon. Most progress will be seen on `dev` branch. This is the first progress made since [roblox-video-codec](https://github.com/iceeburr/roblox-video-codec) died. This might be the start of something bigger.

The library will be published in the future exclusively to Pesde at the moment.

This project was made for a school project about digital data compression methods and algorithms. You will be able to read my works and presentation in both English and Russian in the future. Maybe you can learn something new! Thank you for reading!
